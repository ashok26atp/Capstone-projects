      "I recently read an article about giving students a choice about how they learn. We already set goals; why not let them choose where to sit, and give them options of what to sit on?I teach at a low-income (Title 1) school. Every year, I have a class with a range of abilities, yet they are all the same age. They learn differently, and they have different interests. Some have ADHD, and some are fast learners. Yet they are eager and active learners that want and need to be able to move around the room, yet have a place that they can be comfortable to complete their work.We need a classroom rug that we can use as a class for reading time, and students can use during other learning times. I have also requested four Kore Kids wobble chairs and four Back Jack padded portable chairs so that students can still move during whole group lessons without disrupting the class. Having these areas will provide these little ones with a way to wiggle while working.Benjamin Franklin once said, \\\"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.\\\" I want these children to be involved in their learning by having a choice on where to sit and how to learn, all by giving them options for comfortable flexible seating.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "At the beginning of every class we start out with a Math Application problem to help students see the relevance of topics in math. We are always in groups and do a lot of cooperative activities. We also use lots of technology in our class. I love seeing my students grow and love math!I have a very diverse population of students from all different races, SES, and experiences. My students love school and are starting to embrace the hard work it takes to be a fifth grader.  My school is a 5th/6th grade school only and is considered a school for the middle grades. It is located in a suburban area. It is now more diverse than it has been in many years.I am in an inclusion setting and many of my students have disabilities. It is hard for them to see the board because our resources are old and outdated.  A new document camera for our classroom will allow our students to see the board more clearly during instructional times and will create a classroom environment where lots of movement isn't necessary just because my students cannot see the board.It's frustrating to teach a lesson when many of my students can't see the board because the resources I have are old and outdated. Oftentimes students will tell me to wait before moving on because it takes them forever to write notes because they cannot see the materials.  I want students to enjoy coming to my class to learn math and not feel frustrated because they cannot see the board.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "My students love coming to school and they love learning. I strive daily to make our classroom a relaxed, comfortable and welcoming environment where all learners will excel and grow in their learning. And a new rug will make our days even brighter!My 2nd grade classroom is filled with 20 amazing young learners. These students fill my heart everyday with their passion for learning new things. Working with these students and how engaged they are in each subject matter is so much fun. We are small elementary school in mid-Missouri and we have an 80 percent free and reduced lunch rate. I have a wide range of learners in my classroom, and all of my students learn in different ways. So it is important to provide a learning environment that meets all students.A beautiful new carpet will be the focal point of our classroom. The carpet will be full of students all day long. It will be a clean and comfortable place where my students will find comfort in learning. Students will be sitting in small groups, laying and reading a book or even dancing on the carpet for brain breaks during the day. A carpet in an elementary classroom is the heart of where learning takes place!Thank you for donating or considering a donation to this project. I want to make my 2nd grade classroom as comfortable and inviting as Starbucks or as cozy as a grandma's living room! This beautiful carpet will be a perfect addition to a classroom the is filled with so much excitement and enthusiasm!\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "I teach at a Title 1 school, with 73% of my students who receive free/reduced lunch. Our school provides free breakfast for all students. I am a Special Education certified teacher and I teach Kindergarten in a general education setting with my class that consists 52% students with special needs. The disabilities include Autism Spectrum Disorder, Speech Impaired, Language Impaired, Other Health Impaired (ADHD), and Developmentally Delayed. I also have about 42% of my students who are English Language Learners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Self-motivated learners\\\" is a synonym of \\\"my students\\\".  They love to learn and they possess a positive outlook and attitude in school. Almost everyday, my students would ask me, \\\"Ms. Perez, what are we going to learn today?\\\" I could not ask for a better greeting from my students.This project will greatly impact my students’ learning on a daily basis. The wobble chairs will provide assistance for my students who have difficulties focusing and attending during lessons and discussions. Despite the fact that students participate in physical activities in P.E., Recess, and GoNoodle (dance videos) sessions in our classroom, students still have energy to stand or wiggle from their seats during lessons. Due to these special needs that are beyond the students’ control, there is a lot of distraction and student learning is not really achieved at its full potential. The lack of appropriate stimulation hinders them to focus and learn in class. Students with special needs will be able to sit on the wobble chairs during whole group/small group lessons. This will enable their little active bodies to move while “sitting still” without disrupting other students. As a result, all students will improve focus and increase student attention in learning all content areas. In addition, the visual timer will help my students to actually see the allotted time for activities. This will benefit especially ELL students and students with special needs. Whenever we do independent classwork or work in our centers, the students can refer to it and self-monitor their progress in completing assignments. It will encourage them to use their time wisely and finish tasks on time. It will also help the students have a smoother transition from one activity to another. \\r\\nBy donating to this project, you will significantly help students with special needs have an equal opportunity to learn with their peers. Behavior issues will be greatly minimized and classroom management will be optimized. Help me set all students for success! I am looking forward to seeing my students become active listeners and engaged learners, and always happy to go to school!\\r\\nnannan\n",

Despite the fact that students participate in physical activities in P.E., Recess, and GoNoodle (dance videos) sessions in our classroom, students still have energy to stand or wiggle from their seats during lessons. Due to these special needs that are beyond the students’ control, there is a lot of distraction and student learning is not really achieved at its full potential. The lack of appropriate stimulation hinders them to focus and learn in class. Students with special needs will be able to sit on the wobble chairs during whole group/small group lessons. This will enable their little active bodies to move while “sitting still” without disrupting other students. As a result, all students will improve focus and increase student attention in learning all content areas. In addition, the visual timer will help my students to actually see the allotted time for activities. This will benefit especially ELL students and students with special needs. Whenever we do independent classwork or work in our centers, the students can refer to it and self-monitor their progress in completing assignments. It will encourage them to use their time wisely and finish tasks on time. It will also help the students have a smoother transition from one activity to another.   By donating to this project, you will significantly help students with special needs have an equal opportunity to learn with their peers. Behavior issues will be greatly minimized and classroom management will be optimized. Help me set all students for success! I am looking forward to seeing my students become active listeners and engaged learners, and always happy to go to school!  nannan\n"
